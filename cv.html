        <h1>&nbsp;About me&nbsp;</h1>
        <p>A professional translator and communicator working from English, French and Galician into Spanish. I grew up in Galicia, Spain, and my love for languages led me to study at University of Geneva, while living in France right across the border. With a background in communication, marketing and social media, and over eight years of experience in the non-profit sector, I’m passionate about using language to have a positive impact. You can make my heart sing with creative projects, which is why I enjoy transcreation and literary translation. On that same note, I am also a singer and musician, and I like to constantly learn new skills, so I keep up with a diverse list of hobbies, including reading, baking, knitting and gardening.</p>

            <h2>Spanish Translation Manager and Social Media Coordinator at <a href="https://nutritionfacts.org" target="_blank">NutritionFacts.org</a></h2>
            <p>As the newly-founded Spanish department at NutritionFacts took on more projects, they entrusted me with a staff position. For the first few years, I combined my work there with my studies at University of Geneva, which allowed me to put theory into practice, honing my skills as a translator and communicator. Throughout my extended chapter at the organization, I had the opportunity to work in numerous areas and expand my expertise beyond translation; from social media, to editing, marketing, public relations and website management.</p>
            <p>Some of the projects and tasks I was in charge of or collaborated on include:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Translation and editing of social media content
              <li>Transcreation and copywriting for promotional and fundraising campaigns
              <li>Localization of educational resources, including healthy eating guides, infographics and email series
              <li>Metric analysis to track reach and engagement, helping establish a combined social media presence of&nbsp;225,000+ followers from the ground up
              <li>Social media content scheduling through platforms such as Buffer, TikTok Studio and Later
              <li>Website localization and content management in WordPress
              <li>Localization for Dr. Greger’s Daily Dozen, a habit-tracking app for Android and iOS
              <li>Video editing, Spanish voiceovers and Spanish captions
              <li>Subtitling for long-form lectures and other key video material
              <li>Adapt graphic material to Spanish for use across online platforms
              <li>Cross-team project management with Asana
              <li>Selection of Spanish translation volunteers, with direct impact on output quality
              <li>Management of a small team of volunteers for blog post translations
              <li>Proofreading of biweekly Spanish blog posts
              <li>Team brainstorming to reach strategic planning goals
              <li>Internal initiatives towards content sensitive to food access, economic background and cultural barriers
              <li>Launch and stewardship of an internal book club focused on cross-cultural sensitivity
            </ul>
            <p class="secondary-text">Disclaimer: Not all content seen in NutritionFacts’ platforms was translated or edited by me; this includes social media. A high number of translations were done by volunteers, and content continues to be produced and edited after my departure.</p>

            <h2>Volunteer Translator at <a href="https://nutritionfacts.org" target="_blank">NutritionFacts.org</a></h2>
            <p>As a teenager, I learned that the Internet was a much bigger world if you spoke English. It was around that time that I discovered NutritionFacts and fell in love with their mission. As a non-profit organization, a lot of their translation work is done through volunteers, and I jumped on that bandwagon as soon as the opportunity presented itself.</p>
            <p>During this period, I translated subtitles using the now defunct Google Translator Toolkit and translated and edited transcripts on WordPress. It was around this time that NutritionFacts was getting ready to launch their Spanish website, where I was able to help with string translation. Not long after, they started their Spanish social media pages, which I was more than happy to lend a hand with as well.</p>
            <p>That was the beginning of what would become my professional career, as it helped me decide what studies to pursue, something which I’m extremely grateful for.</p>
